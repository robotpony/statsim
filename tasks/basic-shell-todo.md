# TODO: Command Line Shell Implementation (done)

## Task Overview
Implement the command line shell for the statsim project based on the command structure defined in README.md.

## TODO Items

### Core CLI Structure
- [ ] Set up main CLI entry point (`./statsim`)
- [ ] Implement command parsing and routing
- [ ] Add global flags support (`-h`, `--help`, `-v`, `--version`)
- [ ] Create help system for commands

### Individual Commands (Stub Implementation)
- [ ] Stub `list` command - Print "list command called"
- [ ] Stub `run <name>` command - Print "run command called with: <name>"
- [ ] Stub `show` command - Print "show command called"
- [ ] Stub `stop` command - Print "stop command called"
- [ ] Stub `ps` command - Print "ps command called"
- [ ] Stub `help` command - Use commander.js built-in help

### Configuration & Setup
- [ ] Add commander.js dependency for CLI parsing
- [ ] Update package.json with proper dependencies and bin entry
- [ ] Set up executable permissions for `./statsim`
- [ ] Add proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Implement command-specific help messages

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test all stub commands print correct messages
- [ ] Validate help system functionality
- [ ] Test global flags work (-h, --help, -v, --version)
- [ ] Test executable works from command line

## Architecture Notes
- Main entry point should be in `bin/` directory
- Core CLI logic should be in `src/` directory
- Use commander.js for CLI parsing and command structure
- Follow the exact command structure from README.md
- Stub implementations should print command name and arguments for verification
- Each command will be implemented separately with its own plan later

## Review Section

### Completed Implementation
✅ **CLI Shell Structure Complete** - All tasks completed successfully

**Key Changes Made:**
- Added commander.js dependency for CLI parsing
- Updated package.json with bin entry pointing to ./bin/statsim
- Created executable CLI entry point at bin/statsim with proper shebang
- Implemented all command stubs with commander.js routing
- Added global flags support (-h, --help, -v, --version)
- Set executable permissions on ./bin/statsim

**Commands Implemented (Stub):**
- `./statsim list` → prints "list command called"
- `./statsim run <name>` → prints "run command called with: <name>"
- `./statsim show` → prints "show command called"
- `./statsim stop` → prints "stop command called"
- `./statsim ps` → prints "ps command called"
- `./statsim --help` → shows full command help
- `./statsim --version` → shows version "1.0.0"

**Testing Results:**
All commands tested and working correctly. The CLI shell is ready for individual command implementations.
