# Build System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Adding a complete build system to the statsim project to support TypeScript, testing, linting, and development workflows.

## TODO Items

### High Priority
- [x] Add TypeScript configuration and dependencies for better type safety
- [x] Add build scripts to package.json for compilation and bundling

### Medium Priority  
- [x] Add linting and code formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- [x] Add testing framework and test scripts

### Low Priority
- [x] Add development workflow scripts (clean, dev, watch)
- [x] Update .gitignore for build artifacts

## Implementation Strategy

1. **TypeScript Setup**: Convert the existing JavaScript CLI to TypeScript for better type safety and development experience
2. **Build Pipeline**: Set up compilation from TypeScript to JavaScript in the bin/ directory
3. **Development Tools**: Add linting, formatting, and testing to ensure code quality
4. **Workflow Scripts**: Create convenient npm scripts for development and building

## Notes
- The project already has a working CLI with commander.js
- Need to maintain the existing bin/statsim structure for the executable
- Build output should go to bin/ directory to maintain current usage patterns

## Review

### Changes Made
1. **TypeScript Configuration**: Added TypeScript with strict type checking and proper compiler options
2. **Build System**: Implemented compilation from TypeScript sources to JavaScript binaries
3. **Code Quality**: Added ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting and linting
4. **Testing**: Set up Jest with TypeScript support and basic CLI tests
5. **Development Workflow**: Added comprehensive npm scripts for all development tasks
6. **Git Integration**: Updated .gitignore to exclude build artifacts and coverage reports

### Key Features Added
- `npm run build` - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run dev` - Runs TypeScript directly without compilation
- `npm run test` - Runs Jest test suite with coverage
- `npm run lint` - Lints TypeScript code
- `npm run format` - Formats code with Prettier
- `npm run check` - Runs all quality checks (format, lint, test)

### Project Structure
- Source code moved to `src/cli.ts` (TypeScript)
- Build output in `bin/cli.js` (JavaScript)
- `bin/statsim` executable now delegates to compiled JavaScript
- Tests in `src/__tests__/` directory

All quality checks pass successfully. The build system is production-ready.
