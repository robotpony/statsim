# TODO: Command Line Shell Implementation

## Task Overview
Implement the command line shell for the statsim project based on the command structure defined in README.md.

## TODO Items

### Core CLI Structure
- [ ] Set up main CLI entry point (`./statsim`)
- [ ] Implement command parsing and routing
- [ ] Add global flags support (`-h`, `--help`, `-v`, `--version`)
- [ ] Create help system for commands

### Individual Commands
- [ ] Implement `list` command - List available simulations
- [ ] Implement `run <name>` command - Run a named simulation with progress display
- [ ] Implement `show` command - Show results from latest or named run
- [ ] Implement `stop` command - Stop a running simulation
- [ ] Implement `ps` command - List simulation progress
- [ ] Implement `help` command - Help about any command

### Progress Display
- [ ] Create progress indicator for simulation runs (dots system as shown in README)
- [ ] Implement result display formatting (player rankings with scores)
- [ ] Add simulation completion notification

### Configuration & Setup
- [ ] Create package.json with proper dependencies
- [ ] Set up executable permissions for `./statsim`
- [ ] Add proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Implement command-specific help messages

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test all commands work as expected
- [ ] Validate help system functionality
- [ ] Ensure proper error messages for invalid commands
- [ ] Test executable works from command line

## Architecture Notes
- Main entry point should be in `bin/` directory
- Core CLI logic should be in `src/` directory
- Follow the exact command structure from README.md
- Progress display should match the example format shown
